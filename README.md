This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: the inability to locate or access necessary files or resources. The initial `Dockerfile` contains this issue, while `Dockerfile.fixed` provides a corrected version.  The error is usually related to file paths and permissions during image creation.  This example focuses on Python, but the principle applies across various languages and build processes.
